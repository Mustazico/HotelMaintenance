This was a group project consisting of 3 members
The project is for handling hotel personel tasks. Backend (database) was setup by Fredrik. Frontdesk application for sending request was setup by Susanne. The application to recieve pending tasks application was made by me. 
To see the code I worked on, navigate to WinFormsApp1. Main parts of the code I wrote is in /Form1.cs and PersonnelTask.cs
